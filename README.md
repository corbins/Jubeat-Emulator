Jubeat-Emulator
===============

Portable Jubeat Emulator supporting the Jubeat Memo filetype.  Currently it is a bit limited, and only supports play with an Akai MPD18, and has a few other issues.

You need to provide your own data/ folder, until I create some non-copyrighted resources for testing.

This was initially developed for my CS242 course.
